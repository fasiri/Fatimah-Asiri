# Shipments Estimated Time Delivery Prediction- ML
## Project Proposal: 
E-commerce is one of the biggest Marketplaces. It has developed rapidly day by day and made our life easier. E-Commerce refers to the entire process of marketing, selling, delivering goods, and servicing customers over the Internet. It has revolutionized the way companies do business.

2. Deliver the package on time. 
3. Customer rating. 
## Dataset Description
This dataset was collected from an international e-commerce company based which sells electronic products. It contained more than 10K observations and 12 features. This company wants to use Machine Learning-ML techniques to study their customers to improve the quality of delivering goods and servicing customers to expand their business opportunities. The dataset contains the following information:
- **ID:** ID Number of Customers.
- **Warehouse block:** The Company have big Warehouse which is divided in to block such as A,B,C,D,E.

## The Project Goal 
The goal of this project, is to predict the delivery time required to deliver an order to achive the best analysis for this model. Which can help the company to decide proper estimated delivery time for customer's orders.
## Algorithms
In this project I will use **Linear Regression** for modelling to predict the delivery time of the shipments .
## Questions for Analysis
- Is the product delivered on time or no?
- What is the customer rating?
- Is there any realationship between the product importance and customer rating or deliverd on time?
## Tools
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Numby, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Seaborn.
